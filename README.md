# My Learning App

This is my first complete SwiftUI app where I'm applying everything I've learned so far into one project.

## What I'm Practicing
- Combining all previous SwiftUI concepts
- Creating a cohesive app structure
- Integrating multiple features together

## Features
This app brings together my recent learnings into a single, functional application.

Open in Xcode to see everything working together!
